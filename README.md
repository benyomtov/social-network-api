  ## Installation
  
  In order for this application to function as intended, users can run ```npm i``` in the terminal in order to install the necessary dependencies (express and mongoose). MongoDB must also be installed; installation instructions for MongoDB can be found on their website. It is helpful to have MongoDB's Compass app installed to view the database, as well as Insomnia to test routes.
  
  ## Usage
  
  To use this application, simply type the appropriate endpoint for each route into Insomnia, making sure that the route type (get, put, post, delete) is correct. If posting, JSON data needs to be inputted into Insomnia in the correct format.
